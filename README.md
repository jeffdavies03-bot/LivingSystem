# Living System (v1)

The **Living System** is a standalone, event-centric **Clinical Intelligence Core**.

- **System of Truth:** Living System (events, reasoning, outcomes)
- **System of Record:** PMS (appointments, billing, claims)
- PMSs are **peripherals**, not the brain.

This repository is a **monorepo** that contains:
- Action surfaces (Next.js apps)
- Intelligence engines (TES + BGPT)
- The clinical event registry (Supabase)
